# Cave Survey
This Minecraft mod adds cave maps to the game. These maps use a 3D path-finding algorithm to deliver accurate maps even on slopes and complicated cave systems. This mod is powered by the [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) library so it is fully server-side and does not require any client mod or resource pack.

If you want to install this mod on a server, make sure to check the [wiki](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/wiki) and the [release page](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for more information about support for client side.

You can find information about the item interactions at the [wiki](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/wiki).
