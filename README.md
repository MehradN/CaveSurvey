# Cave Survey
This Minecraft mod adds cave maps to the game. These maps use a 3D path-finding algorithm to deliver accurate maps even on slopes and complicated cave systems. This mod is powered by the [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) library so it is fully server-side and does not require any client mod or resource pack.

You can find information about the installation of the mod and the item interactions at the [wiki](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/wiki).
