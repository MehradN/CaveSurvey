Cave Survey adds advanced cave maps to Minecraft. These maps use a 3D path-finding algorithm to deliver accurate maps even on slopes and complicated cave systems. This mod is powered by the [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) library, so you aren't required to install any resource pack or client mod.

If you want to install this mod on a server, make sure to check the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/wiki/Installation-Guide). <br>
You can find information about the item interactions at the [wiki](https://github.com/MehradN/CaveSurvey/wiki).
